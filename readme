TODO: delete friends if user is deleted
TODO: add middleware to confirm if you are friend

Issues:
1. Can find all existing users while trying to find possible firnds. This is an open friends app. So who's on this app is public.
2. User can spam likes of others' posts (No dislikes. Can't like your own posts. And if you make a new user to like posts, well lets not talk about that)
3. Can't block getting new friend requests or requests from denied users. (You can always ignore them)
4. You can't add image posts yet. This is not instagram. This was made in a day. Deal with it.
5. More privacy features can be added. I'm not doing that though. I'm not really launching this as a new startup right.
